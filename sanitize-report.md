  - `src/tests/middleware/responseHandler.test.js`
  - `src/tests/utils/errors.test.js`
  - `src/tests/utils/auditLogger.test.js`
  - `src/tests/services/socketService.test.js`
  - `src/tests/services/orderProcessingService.test.js`
- **Benefits**:
  - Validation of core functionality
  - Prevention of regressions during future development
  - Documentation of expected behavior

### 7. Audit Logging
- **Description**: Implemented a comprehensive audit logging system.
- **Files Created**:
  - `src/utils/auditLogger.js`
- **Key Features**:
  - Detailed activity tracking
  - User action attribution
  - Resource modification history
  - Queryable audit trail
- **Benefits**:
  - Enhanced security monitoring
  - Compliance with audit requirements
  - Troubleshooting capabilities

## Database Schema Improvements
