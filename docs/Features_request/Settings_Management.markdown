# Settings Management â€” Billiard POS System

## Overview
Implement this entity as a complete subsystem with its own dedicated dashboard, routes, backend services, and modular components. This subsystem centralizes all configurable aspects, including taxes, tips, receipts, security, and UI preferences, with preview modes, backups, and change tracking for easy administration.

## Features
- **Config CRUD**:
  - **Sections Management**: Tabbed forms for categories like Taxes (rate, mode, exemptions), Tips (suggestions, pooling rules), Receipts (templates, widths, logos), Security (PIN rules, idle timeouts), UI (themes, languages, accessibility). Explicit: Real-time previews (e.g., sample receipt); validation wizards.
  - **Edit and Apply**: Inline editors with undo; apply changes system-wide or per-location. Edge case: Staged changes (test before live).
  - **Read Settings**: Hierarchical tree view of all configs; search across keys.
  - **Update Settings**: Bulk updates via JSON editor for advanced users; log all changes.
- **Runtime Application**:
  - **Loading and Caching**: Auto-load on app start; local cache with expiration. Explicit: Hot-reload for non-critical changes (e.g., UI theme).
- **Backups and Restore**:
  - **Export/Import**: Full subsystem backup as JSON/ZIP; versioned with diffs. Explicit: Selective restore (e.g., only taxes); migration tools for updates.
  - **Scheduled Backups**: Auto-daily with retention (keep 7 days).
- **Additional Functionalities**:
  - **Localization**: Settings for currency (MXN/USD), date formats, languages (Spanish default).
  - **Compliance**: Export configs for audits; enforced defaults for legal (e.g., tax rates).
  - **Analytics**: Change impact reports (e.g., "Tax change affects X bills").
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Invalid Configs: Fallback to defaults; error logging with fixes.
  - Concurrent Edits: Locking with notifications (e.g., "In edit by Admin Y").
  - Offline: Local edits with sync queue.
  - Internationalization: Multi-currency support; RTL for languages.
  - Security: PIN for critical sections (e.g., security settings).

## Main Page
Clicking on the Settings Management entity in the main POS navigation opens a whole new subsystem dashboard. This dashboard overviews current configs in collapsible sections, with search bar, change log timeline, and backup status widget. It includes a sidebar for sub-modules (Taxes, Tips, Receipts, Security, UI, Backups, Analytics), quick apply/reset buttons, and preview panes. The dashboard is responsive, with dark mode, and admin-only access.

## Endpoints
- `GET /api/settings/:key?preview={true}` (fetch with preview).
- `PUT /api/settings/:key` (update with validation).
- `GET /api/settings/all` (list hierarchy).
- `POST /api/settings/backup` (export with versions).
- `POST /api/settings/restore` (import with diffs).
- `GET /api/settings/analytics` (impact reports).

## Integrations
- **All Subsystems**: Broadcast config changes for application.
- **Access Management Subsystem**: Secure edits with PIN.
- **Reporting Subsystem**: Log config changes as events.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Config updates apply system-wide; previews accurate.
- Backups restore without loss; scheduled run automatically.
- Searches find keys fast; edits locked concurrently.
