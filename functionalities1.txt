BilliardPOS UI Mockups and Functionalities
Overview
BilliardPOS is a specialized POS system for billiard clubs, managing game time, table controls, lighting (via control boards for 2-32 channels), bar sales, inventory, loyalty, and reporting. It supports two user roles: Operator (table/sales management) and Administrator (settings/reports). The interface is intuitive, requiring 10-20 minutes to train staff. Accounts have no default passwords but can be secured. Hardware includes receipt printers (58mm/80mm) and optional RFID readers. All operations are local (no internet required). A demo version (5-minute table limit) is available.
Below are the functionalities, workflows, and UI mockups for key screens to guide integration into your POS system.

Notes for Implementation

Styling: Use a clean, minimal design with large buttons for touch-friendly operation (e.g., Tailwind CSS for web apps).
Responsiveness: Ensure layouts adapt to desktop and tablet screens (common in POS setups).
Real-Time Updates: Use WebSockets or polling for live table status updates.
Hardware Integration: Mockups assume API endpoints for lighting control and RFID readers.
Accessibility: High-contrast colors, clear labels for operator ease (10-20 min training).
Tech Stack: For a web-based POS, consider React with Tailwind CSS, or a desktop app with Electron for local hardware integration.

These mockups and functionalities should help you replicate BilliardPOS features in your system. For code snippets or specific integrations, provide your POS’s tech stack or requirements.
